# [3rd Data Science's challenge of Talent Squad ](https://nuwe.io/dev/challenges/talent-squad-data-science-iii)
(10th Oct 2022 - 11th Dec 11 2022)]

# Background

#### Influences on academic performance

A study has been carried out to see if the academic performance of children is influenced by the academic level of their parents. Therefore, the academic results of the students will be evaluated based on several variables

**data**
You will be given a dataset of 800 rows for the prediction algorithm training and 200 for the test.

**variables**
'gender' : Sex of the student

'parental level of education': Educational level of the father

'lunch': If you have lunch scholarships

'Exam Preparation Course': Attend academy

'math score': Score in Maths

'reading score': Reading Comprehension

'writing score': Writing score

# Problem

The **purpose of this project** is to ....

Evaluation will be based on the f1_score from predictions of the dataset and the groundtruth (900), code quality (200) and documentation (100). (maximum puntuation 1200).

## Methodology

1. Load and Check initial images to homogenize formats, confirm its availability, check class distribution.

2. Build and train Convolutiona Neuronal Networks / CNNs. An initial screening of different pretrained models which are the base model (initial layers) of the CNN. 

3. Select the best model/s and study deeper with image augmentation, fine tunning by unfreezen last layers of base pretrained model,...

4. Increase training set of images by web scrapping. Images have to be validated: format, dupplicates and right labelling if considered representative (if not discarded).

5. Compare performance of best model with the extended set of training images.

6. Load models & wheights to make predictions with test set of images and get the scoring metrics. 

7. Report results and conclusions.

## Tools

* Python
* Git & Github
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/MarkusHumetus/Image_sports_classification/blob/main/main_Notebook.ipynb)
* Visual Studio Code
* Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Keras, Tensorflow, Selenium, OpenCV, Pillow, bing_image_downloader, 

## Getting Started

1. Clone this [repo](https://github.com/MarkusHumetus/Image_sports_classification) (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Use [requirements.txt](https://github.com/MarkusHumetus/Image_sports_classification/blob/main/requirements.txt) to check all installed dependencies in the working environment. 
3. Check and adapt the paths to the working directories according where files are stored.
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook as administrator. Otherwise, permision conflict will arise when opening image files.

## Project Status

[Finished]

Project was completed and submitted for competition in 23rd of September 2022.

## Results & Conclusions

* The maximum __f1 macro score__ obtained in the classification of the test images was __0.905__. 

* Best results were obtained with __Xception__ and __InceptionResNetV2__ pretrained models with the augmented training set of images.

* No improvements were observed when leaving last 10% layers of the pretained Xception model to be trained again.

* Although __number of images was doubled by web scrapping__, the increase the number in training images didn't improve the performance of the model. 

* As forseen, the __missclassifications occurs between__ the two most similar sports: __baseball and cricket__. 


The [best model as json file](https://github.com/MarkusHumetus/Image_sports_classification/blob/main/Im%C3%A1genes-data-science-ii/output/Xception_pretrained_aug.json) and its [wheigts as h5 file](https://github.com/MarkusHumetus/Image_sports_classification/blob/main/Im%C3%A1genes-data-science-ii/output/Xception_pretrained_aug.h5)  are uploaded on this repository. In the [notebook](https://github.com/MarkusHumetus/Image_sports_classification/blob/main/main_Notebook.ipynb), there is plenty of examples, how it can be loaded and tested with the test data.
Predictions of test images were stored in the file [predictions.csv](https://github.com/MarkusHumetus/Image_sports_classification/blob/main/predictions.csv)

# Acknowledgments

Thanks to the following organisations for the set up of such event which give the junior data scientist oportunities to learn, do networking and hopefully reach a first job in the data field.
